## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb data to understand various aspects such as pricing trends, popular locations, room types, and overall guest satisfaction. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, insights are derived to help stakeholders make informed decisions in the hospitality business.

## Introduction
Airbnb, Inc. is a globally recognized platform offering short-term homestays and experiences since 2008. With millions of listings worldwide, Airbnb has revolutionized travel accommodations by providing unique and personalized experiences for guests.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains around 49,000 observations with 16 columns, consisting of both categorical and numerical values. Key columns include room_id, room_type, city, neighborhood, reviews, overall_satisfaction, price, and more.

## Methodology
The project follows a systematic approach, including:
- Importing necessary libraries for data analysis.
- Reading the dataset and performing data cleaning processes:
-- Handling missing values by imputing appropriate values.
-- Visualizing the presence/absence of null values using heatmaps.
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into various aspects:
--Finding top earners based on property names and visualizing using bar charts.
-- Analyzing booking trends in different locations and their price relations.
-- Examining the relationship between overall satisfaction and pricing.
-- Investigating price variations with respect to amenities and neighborhoods.
-- Exploring the preference of guests concerning room types.
-- Identifying the cheapest and most expensive Airbnb listings.
-- Determining the top locations with the maximum number of bookings.
-- Analyzing the relationship between price and location.
-- Investigating the last modified data and room type modifications.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## Findings
- Top earners include properties like 'Zonnige woonboot, centraal en rustig' and 'One public bedroom'.
- Centrum West and De Baarsjes/Oud West are the top locations with the maximum number of bookings.
- The relationship between price and satisfaction shows that higher prices correlate with lower satisfaction.
- Prime locations such as Centrum West command higher prices compared to others.
- Entire home/apartment types in De Baarsjes/Oud West and De Pijp/Rivierenbuurt are most modified.

## Conclusion
The project offers valuable insights into the Airbnb market, enabling stakeholders to understand pricing trends, popular locations, and guest preferences. By leveraging these insights, hosts and property managers can optimize their listings, improve guest experiences, and make data-driven decisions to maximize revenue and customer satisfaction.
